    title: 'Planning Your Workout Routine',
    info: 'There are several ways to structure your gym routine depending on your goals, schedule, and experience level.\n\nCommon approaches include full-body workouts, upper/lower splits, and push/pull/legs routines.\n\nFull-body workouts are great for beginners and those training three times a week, while split routines allow for higher volume per muscle group.\n\nYour routine should align with your fitness goals—whether it’s strength, hypertrophy, or endurance.\n\nStick to a consistent schedule, progressively increase intensity, and track your progress to ensure long-term improvement.',

    title: 'Nutrition for Performance and Growth',
    info: 'Proper nutrition is essential for muscle growth, recovery, and overall performance.\n\nCalculate your daily calorie needs based on your activity level and goals—whether it’s muscle gain, fat loss, or maintenance.\n\nYour macronutrient intake should be balanced, with sufficient protein (1.6–2.2g per kg of body weight), healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates for energy.\n\nPrioritize whole foods, lean proteins, and hydration to fuel your workouts and optimize recovery.\n\nConsistency in your diet is just as important as your training.',

    title: 'Lift What You Can Control',
    info: 'Using a weight that you can control with proper form is crucial for both progress and injury prevention.\n\nAvoid ego lifting—lifting heavier than you can handle with good technique.\n\nInstead, focus on a weight that allows full range of motion, steady movement, and proper muscle engagement.\n\nBefore performing an exercise, research the correct technique through reputable sources, watch tutorials, and, if needed, ask for guidance from experienced lifters or trainers.\n\nQuality reps will always lead to better long-term gains than simply lifting heavy with poor form.',

    title: 'Hypertrophy and Recovery',
    info: 'Muscle growth (hypertrophy) occurs when you challenge your muscles through resistance training and allow them to recover properly.\n\nTraining intensity, volume, and progressive overload are key factors in stimulating growth.\n\nHowever, muscles grow during recovery, not during the workout itself.\n\nEnsure you get enough sleep (7-9 hours per night), manage stress, and give muscle groups at least 48 hours of rest before training them again.\n\nProper nutrition, hydration, and mobility work also contribute to optimal recovery and long-term muscle gains.',

    title: 'The Importance of Warm-Up and Mobility',
    info: 'A proper warm-up prepares your muscles, joints, and nervous system for exercise, reducing injury risk and improving performance.\n\nStart with 5-10 minutes of light cardio to increase blood flow, followed by dynamic stretching and mobility exercises specific to your workout.\n\nIncorporating mobility work improves range of motion, posture, and overall movement quality, leading to better lifts and long-term joint health.\n\nNever skip your warm-up, as it sets the foundation for an effective and safe training session.',

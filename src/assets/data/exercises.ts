    title: 'Dumbell Bench Press',
    info: 'To perform the dumbbell bench press, lie on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand, keeping your feet flat on the floor. Start with the dumbbells at chest level, palms facing forward, and press them upwards until your arms are fully extended. Lower them slowly and with control back to the starting position, maintaining a steady movement throughout the exercise. Bench Press This exercise primarily targets the chest muscles (pectorals) while also engaging the shoulders (deltoids) and triceps. Using dumbbells instead of a barbell helps improve muscle balance and stability since each arm must work independently, reducing strength imbalances and engaging stabilizing muscles. Keep your back flat against the bench and avoid excessive arching to prevent injury. Use a weight that allows you to maintain proper form throughout the set. Focus on controlled movements rather than speed, and ensure you’re breathing correctly—inhale when lowering the dumbbells and exhale when pushing them up.',

    title: 'Barbell Squat',
    info: 'To perform the barbell squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place a barbell across your upper back, gripping it slightly wider than shoulder-width. Keep your chest up, engage your core, and lower yourself by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if sitting into a chair. Lower until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, then push through your heels to return to the starting position. The barbell squat is a compound movement that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes while also engaging the core and lower back for stability. It helps develop lower body strength, power, and mobility. Keep your back straight and avoid leaning too far forward to prevent stress on your lower back. Ensure your knees track over your toes and don’t cave inward. Start with a manageable weight and focus on proper technique before increasing the load.',

    title: 'Pull-Ups',
    info: 'To perform a pull-up, grip a pull-up bar with your palms facing away from you (overhand grip), slightly wider than shoulder-width. Hang with your arms fully extended, then engage your back and biceps to pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar. Lower yourself slowly and with control back to the starting position. Pull-ups primarily target the latissimus dorsi (lats) while also engaging the biceps, shoulders, and upper back. They are a great compound movement for building upper body strength and improving grip endurance. Avoid swinging or using momentum to complete the reps, as this reduces effectiveness. If you struggle with full pull-ups, start with assisted variations or negatives to build strength. Focus on a controlled movement and full range of motion for maximum benefits.',

    title: 'Deadlift',
    info: 'To perform the deadlift, stand with your feet hip-width apart and grip a barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Keep your back straight, chest up, and core engaged as you hinge at your hips and bend your knees to lower yourself to the bar. Lift the bar by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously until you stand upright. Lower the bar back down with control by reversing the movement. The deadlift is a fundamental compound exercise that targets the posterior chain, including the hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and traps. It is excellent for building overall strength and improving functional movement. Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift to maintain good form and reduce lower back strain. Avoid rounding your back, and engage your core to stabilize the movement. Use a weight that allows proper execution without compromising technique.',

    title: 'Seated Shoulder Press',
    info: 'To perform the seated shoulder press, sit on a bench with back support and hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward. Press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended, then slowly lower them back to the starting position. Keep your core engaged and back straight throughout the movement. The seated shoulder press primarily targets the deltoids (shoulders) while also engaging the triceps and upper chest. Performing the movement seated provides additional stability and reduces strain on the lower back. Avoid locking your elbows at the top to prevent unnecessary joint stress. Use a controlled motion rather than relying on momentum, and choose a weight that allows you to maintain proper form without excessive arching of the back.',
